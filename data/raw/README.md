The raw data (in DICOM) were obtained with an MRI Philips 3T at Centre de recherche universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Qu√©bec (CRIUCPQ).

Description: Longitudinal dataset (4 visits: baseline and 4, 12 and 24 months after weight loss induce by bariatric surgery) of which 3 runs fMRI with the [Becker-DeGroot-Marshack auction task](https://doi.org/10.1002/bs.3830090304) (~10min/run) were collected. The fMRI data of the 3 runs/session/participant were stock in a folder on Alliance Canada (folder's name example: RND050, RND050flw4, RND050flw12, RND050flw24, etc.)

Known Issues
------------
Issue with the convertion of the Dicom files into Nifti files with dcm2niix (convert in 3D instead of 4D)


Where to discuss the dataset
----------------------------
The protocole and the dataset were also describe in [Michaud et al. 2020 Neuroimage](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32145436/) and [Zeighami et al. 2022 Neuroimage](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35760293/)
